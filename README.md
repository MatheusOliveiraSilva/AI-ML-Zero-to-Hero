# AI-ML-Zero-to-Hero

This repository is something that I want to create to share with other people what I did to prepare myself for AI/ML Engineer jobs.

I have created a [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=W6WodQ2DmGdPLl1-7cvkF,5t-8VVEppSi46xSPsnNCSw) board to organize my ideas, you can check this out.

The idea is that you have to at least be good at the basics:
1. Version control
2. SQL + NoSQL
3. Python
4. Pandas/Dask
5. Data structures
6. Prob & stats
7. ML algos
8. Parallel computing
9. REST API
10. Kubernetes + Airflow
11. Unit/integration tests

Saw that on: https://x.com/chipro/status/1315283623910805504 (Chip is the goat).

# Repository organization
Each one of the topics above will have a branch, and I'll organize my study resources there. My goal is to study and pratice the basics, intermediate and advanced of each topic.
