This branch are about transformers, how it works, how we can use then.

## Testing the Hugging Face Transformers Pipeline

In this repository, you'll find a [notebook](./pipeline_test.ipynb) that demonstrates how to use the `pipeline` method from the Hugging Face Transformers library. This method is a simple and efficient way to use pre-trained models for various natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, translation, and more.

The notebook provides practical examples of how to implement and use different pipelines for various applications, allowing you to better understand how to leverage the power of transformers in your own projects.
